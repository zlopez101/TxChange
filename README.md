# TxChange
Secondary Ticket Market for Concerts


## Beginnings
This all started because of some loser named Slim in Los Angeles. Or at least that was his profile name. I was in Los Angeles visiting friends when we decided it would be fun to go to the Mac Demarco Concert on 2/14 at Teragram Ballroom. Stubhub prices were crazy, but we scoured Craigslist that afternoon trying to find tickets that didn't seem too "scammy." Unfortunately, we got taken for a ride anyway by Slimmy boy. 
So...I decided to do something about it. And we'll see where it goes.
